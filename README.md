# dotfiles.
These are my personal tweaks on **macOS**.

*(I miss them A LOT while using someone else's computer.* :sob:*)*

It's quite likely that my workflow won't work for you the way it works for me, since productivity is subjective. Personally, though, it does the job pretty well and keeps me focused on what matters.

## before I start
I'm using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) to install Mac applications, command-line tools and fonts.

Secondly, this repository also includes system preferences, which you can carefully check in my [macOS defaults file](misc/macos).

Lastly, not every file in this repository is being directly used. Some files, such as editor settings, are here for backup purposes.

## let's go
**1.** Check for software updates.
```sh
$ sudo softwareupdate -i -r
```

**2.** Get this project somehow and go to its directory. Using [Git](http://www.git-scm.com/):
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/diessica/dotfiles.git ~/dotfiles
$ cd ~/dotfiles
```

**3.** Install Mac applications (see [caskfile](brew/caskfile)) and fonts (see [fontfile](brew/fontfile)).

```sh
$ sh ./install-apps
```

**4.** Install dotfiles (see [brewfile](brew/brewfile)).

```sh
$ sh ./install-dotfiles
```

**5.** Tell Git who you are.
> I prefer doing it in a separate `gitlocal` file, which is included in my `gitconfig`.

```sh
$ git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.email "{Your email}"
$ git config -f ~/.gitlocal user.name "{Your name}"
```

**6.** Tell [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) who you are.
```sh
$ npm set init.author.name "{Your name}"
$ npm set init.author.email "{Your email}"
$ npm set init.author.url "{Your URL}"
$ npm adduser
```

We can learn a lot about productivity just exploring the way people work every day. Personally, I got highly inspired by [Holman](https://github.com/holman), [Mathias Bynens](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), [Deny Dias](https://github.com/denydias/dotfiles) and [this question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/171563/whats-in-your-zshrc).

I can't agree more with [Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s thoughts on dotfiles: [dotfiles are meant to be forked](http://zachholman.com/2010/08/dotfiles-are-meant-to-be-forked).
